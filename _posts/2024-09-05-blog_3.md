Use your mortgage to build the space of your dreams.

## How to obtain a renovation loan?

If you know you'll be in the home for some time, why not make it your perfect space? Upgrade the kitchen, redo the bathroom, make a finished basement or install new floors without the full amount coming out of your pocket. By performing a mortgage renovation refinance and taking out a larger loan, you can use the equity in your home to fund your renovation plans.


## Reno 'n Roll

It’s just as it sounds: “renovate” your home and “roll” the cost into your mortgage. No credit card payments, no pulling from your personal line of credit. Simply break out of your existing mortgage, secure a new renovation loan with the extra funds you need and enjoy the simplicity of making one payment each month towards your mortgage.


## Take advantage before rates rise again

Interest rates are on the rise. Locking in a renovation loan sooner will save you more by using the equity in your home to do the renovations you’ve had on your mind for some time.
