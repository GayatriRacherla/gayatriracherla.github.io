## When you need a mortgage to build a house

Have you purchased a piece of land that you plan to build on? Do you want tear down your current home to build a new, updated one?Are your plans to construct a second home on your existing property? In all of these scenarios a construction mortgage, sometimes referred to as a builders mortgage, is the ideal solution.

## How it works

A construction mortgage in Canada works differently from your traditional mortgage. Funds are given to you on a progress advancement basis. In other words, you “draw” on the full amount of the builders mortgage at specific stages of the construction project.

If you already own the land you want to build on, your first advance is given to you in the form of an equity takeout. If not, your first lump sum is provided to fund your purchase of a piece of land.

As you construct your new home and reach various predetermined levels of completion, you receive funds, called draws.

## Plan it well

Devise an accurate plan for the new construction of your home because usually construction mortgages cannot be changed after the fact.

As you build, various home inspections and appraisals will be performed (usually at your cost) to ensure that the structure adheres to present-day code and to confirm your eligibility for the next draw.
