## A faster process for First Time Home Buyers

Buying a new home can feel stressful, especially with the paperwork and options to consider. An experienced and trusted mortgage broker can make this a smooth process and help you get pre-approved.

## What will be my downpayment and rates?

It depends on a few things:

- your household income
- how much of your credit you're using today
- your ability to repay the loan (debt-to-service ratio)
- the interest rate you qualify for and if it's fixed or variable
- the mortgage term length (ex: 3 or 5 years)
- the ammortization period (ex: 25, 30 or 45 years)
- what savings you might be able to use towards the downpayment

If you have money to invest, now is a great time to lock in rates before they continue to rise. When you’re ready, we’re here to secure the best possible first time home buyer mortgage for you.
