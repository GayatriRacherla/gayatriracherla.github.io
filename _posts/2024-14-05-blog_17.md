## Why alternative forms of real estate investing are becoming more popular.
In recent years, alternative forms of real estate investing have become more popular with investors who are looking to buy a property with little or no money down. This is because traditional forms of financing, such as bank loans, are becoming harder to obtain.

With house prices rising across Canada and the United States, it’s becoming increasingly more difficult for people to “buy-in” to the real estate market.

To purchase an investment property, most lenders require a 20-30% down payment. This could be anywhere from $20,000 up to $200,000 or more just for a single-family, residential property!

On top of land transfer taxes, surveys, inspections, and lawyer’s fees, these expenses are enough to push many investors out of the market.

## Ongoing real estate expenses
Aside from your down payment and closing costs, investing in real estate also comes with monthly expenses. These include:
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Maintenance and repairs
- Condo and management fees
- Mortgage payments + interest
- Rental and vacancy expenses
- Ongoing property management
This means that investors need to set aside even more money to handle monthly expenses that come up.

Is it possible to invest in real estate without having a large amount of capital available? Absolutely!

Let’s explore some of the most common ways to invest in real estate with little money.

## Fractional investing
Fractional investing is a newer concept that’s gained popularity in recent years. It allows investors to pool their money together to purchase a share of an investment property.

This type of investment is often made through a real estate crowdfunding platform, which connects investors with developers who are looking to finance their projects.

With fractional investing, you can spread your investment amount over multiple properties, which also helps to mitigate risk and increase your diversification.

It’s also a great way to get started in real estate investing with little money as you can typically invest as little as $2500.

## Seller financing
Another option for investors looking to buy a property with little money down is seller financing.

With this type of financing, the seller agrees to act as the bank and provide you with a mortgage. This could be in the form of an interest-only loan or a balloon payment loan.

Seller financing can be a great option for both buyers and sellers. The buyer gets to purchase the property with little money down and the seller gets their asking price for the property.

## REITs
REITs, or real estate investment trusts, are another way to invest in real estate without having to put down a large amount of money. REITs are companies that own and manage income-producing properties, such as office buildings, shopping malls, apartments, and warehouses.

REITs are traded on stock exchanges and can be bought and sold just like any other stock. This makes them a liquid investment, which is ideal for investors who want to cash out quickly if needed.

Since REITs are traded on stock exchanges, they also offer the potential for growth through capital appreciation.

The downside of investing in REITs is that they’re subject to the ups and downs of the stock market. This means that your investment could lose value if the stock market declines. In addition, there are fees associated with owning a REIT and you often don’t have any transparency about the properties that you are investing in.

## Lease-options
A lease option is another creative way to invest in real estate with little money down. With a lease option, you agree to lease a property from the owner for a set period.

The length of the lease will depend on the agreement between the buyer and seller, but it’s typically 1-5 years.
During the lease period, the buyer has the option to purchase the property, but they’re not obligated to do so.

Lease options are a great way to get into a property without having to put down a large amount of money. The downside is that you’re not guaranteed to purchase the property at the end of the lease period.

## Wraparound mortgages
A wraparound mortgage is another financing option for investors looking to buy a property with little money down. With a wraparound mortgage, the buyer agrees to make payments on the existing loan and takes over responsibility for the property.

The buyer then charges their own tenant a higher rent amount and uses that money to make the monthly payments on the mortgage.

Wraparound mortgages can be a great way to get into a property with little money down, but they’re not without risk. If the tenant doesn’t pay their rent on time, the investor could be responsible for making the mortgage payments.

## Conclusion
There are several ways to get into real estate with little money down. The best option for you will depend on your individual circumstances.

If you’re looking for a hands-off investment, crowdfunding may be the way to go. If you’re willing to put in the work, a subject-to-property or a fixer-upper may be the best option. Fractional investing is a great option for people who want to own a piece of real estate without the headaches that come along with maintenance and management.

Whatever route you decide to take, do your research and understand the risks involved.
