Getting a business loan can help you get a new company off the ground or propel an established business to new heights of growth and profitability. But before you can access funds to grow your company, you’ll need to convince a bank to lend you the money.

## Why do I want a business loan?

The first step is to be clear on why you want a business loan. Bankers offer many types of loans to businesses. The right one for you depends on your specific needs.

Different loans are available for everything from starting a new business to scaling up a tech company, investing in equipment, technology or a building, and acquiring another company.

Prioritizing your needs allows you to determine which types of loans are most suitable and how to make your case to a bank.

## Which type of business loan is best suited to my needs?

Types of loans
The next step is to decide which type of loan is best suited to your business.

1. New companies
Businesses with at least 12 months of revenues can apply for start-up financing.
2. Technology companies
Whether you’re an earlier-stage scale-up or an established business, tech firms can secure financing tailored to the technology industry.
3. Smaller loans
Established companies seeking smaller amounts can apply for a small business loan.
4. Commercial real estate
A commercial real estate loan can allow you to:
- buy land or buildings
- pay for construction of a new facility
- expand or renovate existing premises
- replenish working capital depleted by real estate costs

## What are the requirements to get a business loan?
It’s important to do some homework in order to craft a winning loan request. The first step is to gather documents the banker will use to assess your request.

1. Financial statements: 
Banks typically review financial statements to understand a company’s financial health, profitability and capacity to repay debt. For larger loans, statements are needed for the past two years along with interim statements comparing the latest period with the same period in the previous year.

If you don’t have financial statements, tax returns may suffice in some cases, such as for smaller loans.

2. Financial projections: 
Banks typically require a monthly cash flow forecast for the remainder of the current year and the following 12 months. In some cases, two years of projections may be requested.

Be sure to use realistic numbers in projections. “Overly optimistic figures undermine your credibility and could make it harder to obtain future loans if they don’t pan out,” Mittra says.

You may be asked for two sets of financial projections—one based on receiving the loan and a second one showing your forecast if you don’t get the loan.
- How you’ll use the loan: Give details about the project or plans for using the financing and exactly how it will help your business.
- Company details: Give information about your company’s history, current operations, strategy and management team experience.
- Marketing and production plans: Banks want to know about your market, competitive advantage and operational capacity to handle projected sales.
- Supporting documents: You can strengthen your loan application by including supporting documents, such as: 
   - market studies
   - documents to support financial data
   - client testimonials
   - positive media stories about your business
