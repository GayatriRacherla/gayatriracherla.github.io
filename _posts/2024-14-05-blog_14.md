## How do I calculate how much I can borrow for a business loan?
You can use a business loan calculator to determine your monthly payments, the interest cost for financing your project and an amortization schedule.

Then, enter the amounts on your cash flow forecast to see the impact of the loan and projected sales growth from your project.

A rule of thumb is that your borrowing capacity is guided by your net income plus depreciation, less the annual amount of repayments of existing term debt. Any unused room in your borrowing capacity is available to cover new debt service.

You may be surprised at the amount you can afford to borrow. “Newer businesses tend to overestimate their ability to take on a loan,” Mittra says. “On the other hand, more mature businesses often underestimate how much they can afford to borrow.”

Getting a business loan can help you get a new company off the ground or propel an established business to new heights of growth and profitability. But before you can access funds to grow your company, you’ll need to convince a bank to lend you the money.

## How much revenue do I need to be making to get a business loan?
There’s no fixed amount of revenue needed to get a business loan. Banks usually want to see a history of profitability.

## What credit score is needed to get a business loan?
There’s no specific credit score needed to get a business loan. For some loans, the credit score isn’t considered. For others, a good credit score is helpful, but it is still possible to obtain a loan with a suboptimal credit score. Bankers may also consider other aspects, such as financial projections and collateral.

## What can be financed with a business loan?
Business loans can be used for many different purposes, such as:
- buying technology, equipment or machinery
- acquiring another company or a franchise
- investing in a market expansion or new product
- replenishing working capital
- creating or upgrading a website
- improving operational efficiency
- developing a strategic plan
- purchasing or renovating a building
- hiring sales and marketing staff

## My business is in apartment buildings and rental. Am I eligible for a business loan?
BDC doesn’t finance residential real estate projects. But you may be able to obtain such financing from other financial institutions.

## If the source of my rental income is commercial, can I borrow money from BDC?
Yes, in this case you can get a commercial real estate loan.

## Do I need financial statements prepared by an accountant to apply for a business loan?
Accountant-prepared year-end financial statements are usually needed to apply for larger business loans. A bank may also ask for interim statements prepared internally to understand the more recent financial situation. If statements aren’t available, tax returns may suffice in the case of a smaller loan.

## Do I need to include financial projections when I apply for a business loan?
Financial projections are usually required, especially for larger loans.

## Do I need a line of credit before I apply for a business loan?
A line of credit isn’t necessarily required. It depends on the situation.

## Will I need to provide a personal guarantee to get a business loan?
A personal guarantee is required for most types of loans. In some cases, real estate loans don’t require a personal guarantee.

## Do I need to invest money alongside the bank for my project?
It depends on the situation.

## Can an LLC borrow money?
Yes.
