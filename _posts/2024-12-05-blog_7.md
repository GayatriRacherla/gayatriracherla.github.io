Renewing a mortgage opens up hundreds of possible options that can better serve your current situation. We'll help find the one that fits you best.

## Don't sign away an opportunity

Mortgage renewal can seem simple. Your lender sends some papers in the mail and your loan will simply be renewed for another term. Don't make this mistake! Your mortgage renewal doesn't have to be a pre-set transaction – it's an opportunity for you to obtain something better.

## Could debt consolidation also be a fit?

Perhaps your last mortgage was secured with a lender that wasn't your preferred one. Now that you've made a number of mortgage payments, you're in an excellent position to obtain a better mortgage at a better rate with a better lender.
