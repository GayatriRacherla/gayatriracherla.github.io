## Take Out Equity as a Loan

It's possible to take out equity as a loan. This is a great option if you have a large amount of equity in your home and you need to borrow money for any reason. You can use the money for a home renovation, a large debt payout, or a down payment on an investment property or vacation home.

## Home Equity Line of Credit

Give yourself more flexibility by setting up a home equity line of credit that you can use as you need it, without needing to take out a large sum up front. Access flexible cash by using the equity in your home at a reduced rate compared to other financial products.

## Finance a Renovation

If you're looking to renovate your home, you can use the equity in your home to finance the renovation project. This can be used for upgrading a kitchen, renovating a bathroom, installing new floors and even finishing the basement.
