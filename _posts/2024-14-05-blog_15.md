The bank may also request other documents depending on the type or size of loan or business. Here are some of the documents you could be asked for.

| Document | Explaination & Details |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Purchase offer or sale agreement for a business, real estate or equipment | Draft agreements may be acceptable. |
| Ownership chart showing share percentage of beneficial owners | Due diligence is typically done on every owner possessing more than 25% of shares or having control in the business. |
| Trust agreement if beneficial owners include trusts | The trust agreement and copies of tax filings of the trust are typically requested for the last three years. |
| Source of accumulated wealth and fund availability for downpayment | Bankers may need to understand how wealth accumulated in the business and where personal funds came from. |
| Environmental assessment report | For projects with a possible environmental component, an assessment report may be requested during the bank’s due diligence. The report would ideally be prepared by bank-approved environmental vendors. |
| Detailed construction cost estimate/budget | Typically requested for construction and renovation projects. |
| Quote or invoice/budget for equipment | May be requested depending on the equipment acquisition timeline and type of equipment. |
| Line of credit agreement | May be requested if you have a line of credit with a chartered bank or other lenders. |
| Accounts receivable and payable aging reports| These reports showing the duration of outstanding accounts receivable and payable may be requested if they aren’t included in year-end and interim financial statements.|
